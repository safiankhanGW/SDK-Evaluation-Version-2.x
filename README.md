# SDK2.01 Evaluation
Evaluation version of the Glasswall File Trust SDK (Alpha) expires 20/02/2020

This project can be used to build a CentOS7 image, containing version 2 of the Glasswall core engine. The engine is configured to run files in both analysis and protect modes. File are processed from a mounted directory and regenerated into a separate output directory.
Begin by downloading the files to a clean workspace. Check that the dockerfile is in the same directory as the release package (The lib folder containing all the Core 2 libraries and GWQtCLI) the release package which can be found here: https://github.com/filetrust/SDK2.01Evaluation. 

If you haven’t used docker before you will need to install it now. You will need to share the drive you want to input and output data from with your instance of docker. To do this right click docker in the system tray. Click settings. Click Shared Drives and share the appropriate drive. Click Apply.

To build the image open a PowerShell window in the dockerfile directory. Run the following command:
docker build -t *imageName*:0.2 .     (include the white space and trailing period)
This will produce a docker image with the configured *imageName*.

Before we run a container of the image lets create an input directory and an output directory, for instance:

•	C:\data\input – Place files to be processed here.

•	C:\data\output – Note that your output directory must be empty or Glasswall will fail to produce an output and will destroy any data present in there.

Now let’s mount the input and output directories and run a container of our image, using the following command:
docker run -it -v C:\data\input:/input -v C:\data\output:/output *imageName*:0.2

This command will build the container and mount "C:\data\input" to "/input" on the container and "C:\data\output" to "/output" and then immediately process the contents of "/input" and place the regenerated files and analysis reports in "/output".

NOTES:

Please be aware that the current release of the Glasswall Core2 Engine does not support PDF.
The Content Management switches are set to the default behaviour which is to Sanitise all Active Content.

The following changes can be made to the dockerfile to give additional functionality:
line 15 can be changed and suffixed "-r" to give the ability to recursively scan input directories note that this will work with the default mode and with the following edits.

line 15 can be changed to "CMD /home/glasswall/GWQtCLI -i /input -o /output -x export" to produce export packages instead of analysis reports and regenerated files, please note that the streams for the export package are currently only available in the SISL format.

line 15 can be changed to "CMD /home/glasswall/GWQtCLI -i /input -o /output -x import" to reimport exported archives and produce regenerated files and analysis reports.

This is also available in a pre-built docker image in the following location: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/glasswallsolutions/evaluationsdk
